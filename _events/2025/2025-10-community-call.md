On October 10, it’s time for our monthly community call! This one falls right after USRSE’25, so many of us will be just returning from an exciting week of travel, talks, and connections. Instead of a formal program, we’re keeping things light — come join us for a relaxed virtual hangout with fellow RSEs, swap conference highlights, and simply unwind together. No agenda, just open conversation and community connection! And if you weren’t able to attend the conference, this is a great chance to hear impressions and stories directly from your colleagues. 

Everyone is welcome to join the discussion or just hang back and listen in. If you prefer just to listen in, that is perfectly fine, but we encourage you to share your opinions and thoughts as you feel comfortable. 

#### Registration details

Information on how to register for the Zoom meeting will be sent via email
and posted in the `#general` channel on Slack. The registration link can also be found in the pinned messages and channel description of the `#communitycalls` channel on Slack.
